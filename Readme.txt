This application is designed to make it easier to launch remote desktops.

The idea is that a list of all the computers exists so that ip's, 
usernams and domains don't have to be remembered. It uses an RDP file
to launch the remote desktop program.

There is no installation, just download the zip and extract it to a folder. Then you can run the program from the folder or create a shortcut and place it where you need it.

TO DO:
- Drag and drop computers to different folders
- Edit default Remote desktop settings
- Password manager
- Language localisation
- Remember open and close state of tree items.
